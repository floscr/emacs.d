PR Review the following diff with these rules:

* Clojurescript files

** Do not use anonymous functions in a component callback

```cljs
[:> dropdown-menu-item* {:on-click #(modal/show! :tokens/import {})}]
```

This should be extracted to a `(mf/use-fn)`

** Make sure functions in components are wrapped in `(mf/use-fn)` and `(mf/deps)` are added, e.g.:

```cljs
;; Single line without deps
(mf/use-fn #(dom/click (mf/ref-val dir-input-ref)))

;; Multi line with deps
(mf/use-fn
  (mf/deps a b)
  (fn [])
    (+ a b))
```

** Make sure any new components use the new component structure with * suffix, e.g.:

```cljs
(mf/defc component-name* [])
```

And are used like this:

```cljs
[:> component-name*]
```

* Stylus files

** Stylus files use the same name as their component, e.g.: sidebar.cljs - sidebar.scss
** Make sure unused class names are removed


* Translations (ending with .po extension)

** Add the translation file location to the translations e.g.:

```
+#: src/app/main/ui/workspace/tokens/sidebar.cljs:413
+msgid "labels.import-directory"
+msgstr "Import directory"
```

** Translations should not be uppercase - this should be handled by css
