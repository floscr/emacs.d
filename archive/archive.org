This is where I keep functions and config that I don't use at the moment, but am not ready to discard (or loose it in git history).

* Packages & Config

** Treesitter

Tree sitter looks awesome, but it's too early to really use it for now.

It adds some extra syntax highlighting, but wont be of any use, until we can completely replace emacs syntax highlighting. (Otherwise you load 2 syntax highlighters).

There's also no real information how to do ~AST~ transforms with functions (which would be my main reason to use it).

*** Package

#+begin_src elisp :tangle packages.el
(package! tree-sitter)
(package! tree-sitter-langs)
#+end_src

*** Config

#+begin_src elisp
;; config for tree-sitter
(use-package! tree-sitter
  :config
  (require 'tree-sitter-langs)
  (global-tree-sitter-mode)
  (add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode))
#+end_src
